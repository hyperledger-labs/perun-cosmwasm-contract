This repository contains an implementation of the [Perun](https://perun.network/) smart contract for [CosmWasm](https://www.cosmwasm.com).

## Repo structure
* `src/`
  * `contract.rs`, `msg.rs`, `storage.rs` core logic
  * `types.rs` custom types
  * `errors.rs` custom errors
  * `crypto.rs` signature helpers
  * `tests/` tests
* `examples/`
  * `schema.rs` schema generation
* `schema/` generated JSON schemata
* `Cargo.toml` rust project configuration
* `Makefile.toml` build commands


## Development Workflow
Ensure [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is installed with target `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `cargo` is available.
Consult the [CosmWasm documentation](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/0.16/getting-started/installation) for guidance.

This project uses [`cargo-make`](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) to run dev related tasks. Install it with:  
```sh
cargo install cargo-make
```
You can then use the following command to run all CI checks:
```sh
cargo make ci
```

## Protocol

A channel is opened by depositing funds for it into the contract by calling *Deposit*.
The participants of the channel can then do as many off-chain channel updates as they want.
When all participants come to the conclusion that the channel should be closed, they set the final flag on the channel state, and call *Conclude*.
All of them can then withdraw the outcome by calling *Withdraw*. 

*Dispute* is only needed if the particpants do not arrive at a final channel state off-chain.
It allows any participant to enforce the last valid state, i.e., the mutually-signed state with the highest version number.
A dispute is initiated by calling *Dispute* with the latest available state.
A registered state can be refuted within a specified challenge period by calling *Dispute* with a newer state.
After the challenge period, the dispute can be concluded by calling *Conclude* and the funds can be withdrawn.

```

## Schema generation
All `json` schema files can be found in directory `schema/`.
You can generate them with:  
```sh
cargo make schema
```

## Release build
A reproducible and optimized production build can be created with:
```sh
cargo make optimize
```
This command requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com).
The compiled contract will be placed in `artifacts/`.
